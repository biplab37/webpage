### Mathematical Prerequisite to General Relativity
General Theory of relativity seems to be daunting to most of the students. Study of the subject demands the knowledge of mathematics which is beyond the familiar linear algebra and calculas in real variable. Typical General relativity books does not go into the detail mathematical structure of the theory which sometime create confusion among students. In this project we studied the basis mathematical stucture needed to at least understand the Eienstein equation. We start with the notion of Manifolds and gradually build the machinery needed to talk about curvature of space-time. The [report](../../../pdfs/summerprojectreport2017.pdf) is kept as mathematically rigourous as can be done keeping the notion intuitive enough.

### Coulomb Blocade Oscillation in Quantum Dots
Quantum Dots are nanoscale confinement of electrons or holes. The dot is accompanied by two reservoirs, namely source and drain, and a gate. Adjustung the potential at the gate one can control the flow of electron from source to drain via the dot. Conductance through the quantum dot with varying gate-voltage shows oscillations known as the Coulomb Blockade oscillation. The amplitude and the lineshape of the peaks heavily depends on the temperature (typical temperature of the dot ~ 10mK) hence one can calculate the temperature of the dot from experimental data. Interestingly this calculated temperature comes out to be greater than the temperature of the dilution refrigerator. This phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that at low enough temperature phonon bath freezes making it difficult for the dot to release the heat formed during the experiment.
