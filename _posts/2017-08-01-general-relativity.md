title: Mathematical Prerequisite to General Relativity
---
General Theory of relativity seems to be daunting to most of the students. Study of the subject demands the knowledge of mathematics which is beyond the familiar linear algebra and calculas in real variable. Typical General relativity books does not go into the detail mathematical structure of the theory which sometime create confusion among students. In this project we studied the basis mathematical stucture needed to at least understand the Eienstein equation. We start with the notion of Manifolds and gradually build the machinery needed to talk about curvature of space-time. The [report](../../../pdfs/summerproject2017.pdf) is kept as mathematically rigourous as can be done keeping the notion intuitive enough.
