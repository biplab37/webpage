title: "Quantum Dot Thermometry"
description: Coulomb Blockade Oscillation
---
Quantum Dots are nanoscale confinement of electrons or holes. The dot is accompanied by two reservoirs, namely source and drain, and a gate. Adjustung the potential at the gate one can control the flow of electron from source to drain via the dot. Conductance through the quantum dot with varying gate-voltage shows oscillations known as the Coulomb Blockade oscillation. The amplitude and the lineshape of the peaks heavily depends on the temperature (typical temperature of the dot ~ 10mK) hence one can calculate the temperature of the dot from experimental data. Interestingly this calculated temperature comes out to be greater than the temperature of the dilution refrigerator. This phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that at low enough temperature phonon bath freezes making it difficult for the dot to release the heat formed during the experiment.
